# Q-State-Arena-Learning-Quantum-Gates
A mini project aiming to help understand and visuvalize quantum gates and qubits.

*A gamified, interactive 2-qubit quantum state simulator with Bloch sphere visualization.*

Quantum State Builder is an educational and interactive Python application that lets users create, manipulate, and measure 2-qubit quantum states using real quantum gates. It visualizes each qubit on a Bloch sphere, displays joint-state probabilities, and guides the player through multiple quantum challenges — including creating Bell states and phase-entangled states.

The project uses **Tkinter** for the GUI and **Qiskit** for quantum simulation, with **Matplotlib** for 3D Bloch sphere rendering and a custom “entanglement glow” effect.

## 🚀 **Features**

### 🎮 **Gameplay & Levels**

The game consists of **five progressive levels**:

1. Prepare `|00⟩`
2. Prepare `|11⟩`
3. Prepare the superposition `|++⟩`
4. Create a Bell state `|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2`
5. Create the phase-entangled state `( |01⟩ + i|10⟩ ) / √2`

Each level evaluates your state’s **fidelity** and awards points when successful.

### ⚛️ **Quantum Gate Controls**

You can apply common single-qubit and two-qubit gates:

| Gate | Description                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X    | Bit flip                                           |
| Y    | Bit + phase flip                                   |
| Z    | Phase flip                                         |
| H    | Hadamard (superposition)                           |
| S    | Phase π/2                                          |
| T    | Phase π/4                                          |
| CX   | Controlled-NOT (custom control & target selection) |

### 📊 **Real-Time Visualization**

The interface includes:

* **Two Bloch spheres** (one per qubit)
* **Glow effect** that intensifies as the qubits become mixed/entangled
* **Joint state probability bar chart**
* **Statevector amplitude & probability readouts**
* **Action history log**
* **Level challenge description**

---

### 🧪 **Measurement & Fidelity Checking**

* Simulate measurements using Qiskit Aer (200 shots)
* Verify fidelity against the target state for each challenge
* Automatically normalize statevectors
